# simple_c_lib
A set of fairly unrelated small c/c++ service functions, that can be reused anywhere.

All pieces of code are self-contained, well-tested and proven to be simple straightforward and space and time effective.

- *base64.c* - encode/decode data to base 64.
- *calc.c* - calculates expressions `+-*/ sin ln ^` extend it as needed.
- *eq_wild.c*	match string against wildcard having `*?` in it.
- *sscanf.c* - conplete standard-conforming implementation of stdlib sscanf.
- *utf8.c* - encode/decode text in utf8, also fixes surrogates.
- *gunit.h, gunit.cpp* - a poorman's implementation of gunit subset.
